## How it works

Hook up ADALM2k to input port 1 and watch as the output LED lights up based on the input. While the ADALM2k charges the input port, the current from the ADALM2k charges the 8 bit width register, when the register reaches threshold, the register releases a pulse that can be seen in the output LED.

## How to test

Test it by using the ADALM2k with wired leads.

## External hardware
